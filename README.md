# ACO_TSP
Ant Colony Optimization used for TSP(Traveling Salesman Problem), then tuning the parameters and after finding set of optimized parameters, we run our algorithm for the two national instances(Canada &amp; Uruguay) of TSP.

### Implement the methods below of class ACO
- getNextCity(sol)
- heuristic2opt(sol)
- globalUpdate(best)
- localUpdate(sol)
- runACO(numberIteration)
### Tuning the parameters
As required by many artificial intelligence methods, it is first necessary to tune the set of parameters so that the algorithm can achieve its best performance. Let P = {q0, beta, rho, phi, K}be our set of parameters.
### Running algorithm
Now it is time to optimize a larger instance of TSP. Using your set of optimized parameters, you will run your algorithm for the two national instances of TSP: Uruguay with 734 cities and Canada with 4663 cities.
## The detailed info is on the Report "tp3-ai".
